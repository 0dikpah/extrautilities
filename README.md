Extra Utilities
==============

Issue tracker

Add bugs as issues and I'll get to them... sometime.

Note: As of now, I am no longer developing for 1.6 and any outstanding bugs or issues will NOT be fixed.


Note: If you are having a problem with missing textures and are using Optifine - this is an Optifine bug. Custom texture loading changed in 1.7 and they have not updated their code to reflect this. This is not an Extra Utilities bug.
